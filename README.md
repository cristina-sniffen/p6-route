# p6-route

In this project, I implemented a routing service that represents the United States highway network as a graph and calculates routes and distances on this network. I created a GraphProcessor which stores a graph representation and provides public methods to answer connectivity, distance, and pathfinding queries using a variation of Dijkstra's Algorithm.
